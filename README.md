# Didactic Notebook About Accelerating Matrix Multiplication
This notebook gives a short introduction to different approaches to accelerating matrix multiplication.
It primarily concerns the Strassen Algorithm, as well simple parallelisation schemes, and provides some literature pointers to further material.

To reproduce all the plots, ensure you `pip install time numpy matplotlib tqdm joblib`.

This notebook was put together as coursework for the Scientific Computing course at the Doctoral Training Centre, University of Oxford.
